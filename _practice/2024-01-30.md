1. Read the notes. If you have any questions, post an issue on the course website repo. 
2. Using your terminal, download your KWL repo. Include the command used in your badge PR comment. Be sure it is not inside another repository. 
3. Try using setting up git using your favorite IDE's git integration (not its terminal) or GitHub Desktop. Make a file {index}`gitgui.md` and include some notes of how it went. Give the file a heading like `# Setting up <tool name>` with the actual tool name you setup in the title (eg Github Desktop or VSCode source control panel or ...). Was it hard? easy? what did you figure out or get stuck on? Is the terminology consistent to the terminal or does it use different terms?
4. Design a small demo to illustrate the difference between git add and git commit and how they impact `git push`. Write your demo in {index}`stage_commit.md`. Compare what happens based on what you can see on GitHub and what you can see with git status. Denote what you can tell about each case from the terminal and what you can tell from GitHub.com. For this demo, test things either using the files for this badge in your KWL repo or create a new sandbox repo where your account (not the course) is the owner.
