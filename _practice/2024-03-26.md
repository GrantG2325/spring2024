1. Answer the following in {index}`hpc.md` of your KWL repo:  (to think about how the design of the system we used in class impacts programming and connect it to other ideas taught in CS)
    ```
    1. What kinds of things would your code need to do if you were going to run it on an HPC system? 
    2. What sbatch options seem the most helpful?
    3. How might you go about setting the time limits for a script? How could you estimate how long a script will take?
    ```
2. configure [ssh keys for your github account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)
3. Find 2 other encyrption algorithms that could be used wiht ssh (hint: try `man ssh` or [read it online](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ssh.1.html)) and compare them in {index}`encyryption_compare`.  Your comparison should be enough to advise someone which is best and why, but need not get into the details. 
4. Read through this [rsa encryption demo site](https://people.cs.pitt.edu/~kirk/cs1501/notes/rsademo/) site and use it to show what, for a particular public/private key pair (based on small primes) it would look like to pass a message, "It is spring now!" encrypted.  (that is encypt it, and decrypt it with the site, show it's encrypted version and the key pair and describe what would go where). Put your example in {index}`rsademo.md`.
