1. Practice using git to fix problem using a git command from the [patching or debugging section of the docs](https://git-scm.com/docs). Create a log of what you did using the history or git log into a file {index}`git_debug_story.md`. If you have a project in another class or another badge in this class that causes you to use one of these features in a real scenario, that can count.  If not, for example, you could create a "bug" and then use bisect to find it.  
2. Create {index}`tagtypes.md`  with the template below. Include an experiment that shows which if either type of tag creates a new git object. There are two types, try creating one of each a lightwight tag (provide only the tag name- what we did in class) and an annotated (provide a name and a message with `-m`).  
3. Determine how  many of the tags in the course website are annotated vs lightweight using. (You may need to use `git pull --tags` in your clone of the course website)

```
# Tags

<!-- short defintion/description in your own words of what a tag is and what it is for -->


## Comparing tag types 

<!-- include your experiment terminal history  and interpretation -->

## Inspecting tags

Course website tags by type: 
- annoted:
- lightweight: 
<!-- include lists of tags for each type -->
