1. Review the notes, [jupyterbook docs](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html), and experiment with the `jupyter-book` CLI to determine what files are required to make `jupyter-book build` run. Make your kwl repo into a jupyter book. Set it so that the `_build` directory is not under version control. Complete basic customization setps for the necessary files and ensure that you do not add template files to your KWL repo. 
2. Learn about the documentation ecosystem in another language that you know using at least one official source and additional sources as you find helpful. In {index}`docs_ecosystems.md` include a summary of your findings and compare and contrast it to jupyter book/sphinx.  Include a [bibtex based bibliography](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/content/citations.html) of the sources you used. You can use [this generator](https://url-to-bibtex.vercel.app/) for informal sources and [google scholar](https://digitalmeasures.oregonstate.edu/training/export-bibtex-google-scholar) for formal sources.
   
**explore idea** extend the conversion of your repo into a jupyter book by making links among pages, adding an intro, and adding a github action so that a pdf is generated and added to an [orphan branch](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout/2.14.6#Documentation/git-checkout.txt---orphanltnewbranchgt) named `gh-pages`. Plus use at least 2 other jupyter book features from the docs, specify or discuss, your extended features with Dr. Brown in your proposal.
