*the text in `()` below is *why* each step is assigned*

1. review today's notes after they are posted, both rendered and the raw markdown versions. Include links to both views in your badge PR comment. (to review + there are hints for some of the following there)
1. read Chapter 1, "Decoding your confusion while coding" in [The Programmer's Brain](https://www.manning.com/books/the-programmers-brain#toc) add a file called {index}`brain.md` to your kwl repo that summarizes your thoughts on the chapter. Do you think this information will help you approach learning more effectively? why or why not? How, if at all, does it changes how you think about debugging and learning to program? Give examples of how you have encountered the different types of confusion in your prior programming experiences. (to help you get good strategies and prime for things we will see in the next few weeks)
2. Make a concept map of  your current understanding of git and github {index}`git-baics-mapmd`. Use [mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) syntax, to draw your map. GitHub can render it for you including while you work using the preview button. (review what we have learned so far; think about connections + learn a new tool)
3. Read more about [version control in general](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control) and add a "version control" row to your KWL chart with all 3 columns filled in. (git is version control, but not the only one)
