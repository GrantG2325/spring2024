1. Read the notes. If you have any questions, post an issue on the course website repo. 
2. Using your terminal, download your KWL repo. Include the command used in your badge PR comment. Be sure it is not inside another repository. 
3. Try using setting up git using your favorite IDE's git integration (not its terminal) or GitHub Desktop. Make a file {index}`gitgui.md` and include some notes of how it went. Give the file a heading like `# Setting up <tool name>`, with the actual tool name you setup in the title (eg Github Desktop or VSCode source control panel or ...) Was it hard? easy? what did you figure out or get stuck on? Is the terminology consistent to the terminal or does it use different terms?
