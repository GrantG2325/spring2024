Your task is to help prevent students from carrying misconceptions on to future classes. 

You may choose either *one* of these two formats. 
Your task is to clear misconceptions.


For every 4 vocabulary level misconceptions you address, you can earn 1 review badge, up to a maximum of 3 badges across the two types. 

**You may discuss your work with class mates but must submit work individually and should explain the misconception in your own words**

Each question will have 3 parts:
- the question with answer options; 1 correct and 3 wrong
- hint/replies that could be sent to a student that picked each option
- an overall explanation of the misconception(s) with **links to high quality external references and/or class notes**. 


You will work in a  [dedicated repo for this](https://classroom.github.com/a/l6vXF5Lv) so that you work with a group. The repo's README has more detailed instructions including an option for explore badges instead.
